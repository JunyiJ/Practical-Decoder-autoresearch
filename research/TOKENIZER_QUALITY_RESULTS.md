# GPT-2 tokenizer quality results

Updated October26,2026 (Los Angeles). The new campaign is running under the
human's instruction to continue until interruption. The first full baseline is complete; no candidate improvement has been established yet. Follow the [frozen protocol](TOKENIZER_QUALITY_PROTOCOL.md).

## Synced baseline and implementation

GitHub was fast-forwarded from `63d3970` to `ce274e5` (28 commits). The final
reviewed character recipe—not the retrospectively lowest individual seed—is the
starting architecture/training baseline. Tokenizer implementation and protocol
are in `84d0dba` on `codex/tokenizer-quality`, pushed to GitHub.

The default training configuration now uses GPT-2 BPE with50,257 vocabulary
entries. Legacy configs without a tokenizer field retain character behavior.
Training, resume, checkpoint evaluation, generation and inference comparison
use the saved tokenizer; raw and H200 checkpoints bind its identity. The new
no-output-bias binding removes the obsolete65-character prior while preserving
all inherited architecture policies. Character weights are not loaded into
incompatible vocabulary tables.

Raw-text80/10/10 boundaries are unchanged; each split is encoded separately:

| Split | Raw UTF-8 bytes | GPT-2 tokens |
|---|---:|---:|
| Training | 892,315 | 267,688 |
| Validation | 111,539 | 34,279 |
| Reserved test | 111,540 | 36,059 |

Tokenization counts are not test evaluation. Test loss remains closed. Full
validation scores34,278 targets, excluding the first token and its3 bytes,
covering111,536 target bytes. At3,000 updates×1,024 targets, the nominal token
exposure is11.476 training-corpus passes. Random sampling can overlap; this is
not a claim of uniform coverage. Subword CE cannot be compared with character CE.

## Correctness and resource pilots

333 targeted CPU tests passed in172.65s. These cover raw-text boundaries,
Unicode/literal-special-marker round trips, private sampler RNG, legacy paths,
actual training, exact CPU resume, tokenizer mismatch rejection, generation,
EMA exports and affected model/evaluator/cache contracts. This was a targeted
regression run, not the entire historical repository suite.

The synced archive verified3,893 metadata files and1,940 knowledge records.
Two serial40-update MPS pilots on source `84d0dba` completed. Each exported and
loaded raw/H200 checkpoints, evaluated every declared validation target and
produced a fixed-prompt generation sample.

| Width | Parameters | Training time | End-to-end worker time | Raw + H200 bytes | Recorded training RSS |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 64 | 6,629,120 | 4.716s | 11.648s | 132,051,020 | 468.8MiB |
| 256 | 28,851,200 | 7.237s | 15.654s | 564,819,660 | 587.8MiB |

RSS is the trainer's process-lifetime peak observation at its final logging
point; export/scoring can occur later. The sampled worker watchdog remained
active. Pilot schedules/EMA tails are shortened correctness settings; their CE
values and samples are excluded from quality rankings.

A saved-artifact review verified request/checkpoint hashes, exact config and
runtime/tokenizer contracts,40-step private training-sampler replay, untouched
test RNG,21 EMA snapshots, finite raw/H200 tensors, parent/export lineage,
validation coverage and CE/BPB arithmetic. This was a same-agent review, not
an independent reviewer or a training/scoring rerun.

Observed checkpoint sizes project about4.63GiB for the maximum18 full trials,
or6.95GiB with50% headroom. Scaling observed pilot training times projects about
2.08 training hours for18 trials, before full-run overhead; these are forecasts.
The round has an8GiB free-space reserve,12GiB output cap, and per-worker memory
and time guards. Pilots do not establish3,000-update stability.

## Preserved failures and lessons

- Initial CPU pass:253 passed, one test-fixture failure. A character-length
  fixture became too short for a128-token validation window after BPE. The
  fixture was enlarged; sampler boundary checks were retained.
- Intermediate CPU pass:331 passed, one import failure. Source was edited while
  the process had cached an earlier module version. The final333-case run used
  unchanged source and passed. Source stays frozen during quality training.
- An append-only knowledge record was successfully inserted, then its ID was
  mistakenly treated as an object by the recording script. The existing record
  was read back without duplicate insertion or altering evidence.

These are implementation/validation failures, not failed quality comparisons.
Original logs and metadata are checked in under [pilot evidence](tokenizer-evidence/pilots-001/).
Binary training checkpoints remain in local ignored `research_runs/`.

## Updated research direction

The human has directed inference-aware GQA/MLA adoption: better or neutral
quality can qualify when measured inference cost improves. The follow-up also
prioritizes Kimi-style KDA/KDA/KDA/MLA with bounded tuning, rather than treating
the historical all-KDA result as a hybrid test. See the checked
[attention roadmap and primary-paper findings](TOKENIZER_ATTENTION_ROADMAP.md).
The active LR experiment and its selection rule are unchanged.

The latest human steering makes architecture a central research objective:
attention/hybrids, sparse and shared experts, activations, normalization,
residual topology/scaling, depth/width allocation and embedding/readout design.
The [architecture agenda](TOKENIZER_ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md) records structural
hypotheses, comparison controls and scheduling. The human clarified that this
means architecture exploration alongside hyperparameter tuning, not replacing
tuning or imposing architecture-only ordering. Both remain first-class research
directions; evidence determines the next finite round. These are planned
comparisons, not measured gains.

## Active quality round

`research_runs/tokenizer-quality-001` is running one MPS worker at a time. Its
[frozen plan](tokenizer-evidence/quality-001/plan.json) compares peak LRs0.01,
0.005 and0.0025 with paired screen seeds2601/2602 at width64,3,000 updates each.
The selected recipe is frozen before fresh-seed confirmation at widths64/256.
The inherited0.01 recipe remains the baseline until the full adoption rule passes.

The current chat's five-minute heartbeat continues review, records learnings,
checks in results and advances to new justified finite rounds until human stop.
It reports substantive changes or failures and stays quiet when nothing changes.
The old character/null heartbeat remains paused, and campaign006 remains stopped.

## First completed baseline: screening seed2601

The width64 inherited LR0.01 trajectory completed all3,000 updates. It passed
the saved-artifact audit: config/tokenizer/request/checkpoint hashes, finite
model and optimizer tensors, optimizer step counts and independent decay,
101 EMA snapshots, training sampler replay, untouched test RNG, and exact
validation coverage/CE/BPB arithmetic. No training or scoring was rerun.

| Recipe | Raw validation CE | H200 validation CE | H200 bits/byte | Training time | Worker wall time |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Width64, seed2601, LR0.01 | 5.859556 | 5.610844 | 2.487729 | 254.74s | 262.21s |

These are subword-token losses from one screening seed, not a final quality
comparison. H200 improves this trajectory's raw endpoint by0.248712 CE, a
correlated diagnostic rather than an independent experiment. The fixed sample
is readable Shakespeare-like dialogue but has grammatical and semantic defects;
it is not a quality selector.

On the separate fixed sampled-validation panel, CE fell to4.8580 at update600
then rose to5.6499 at update2999 while training-minibatch loss fell. This is a
validation-degradation warning under the inherited budget. It does not isolate
overfitting, LR, schedule or repeated text exposure as the cause. A shorter
horizon is a justified candidate for a subsequent finite experiment after this
LR round; no early-checkpoint selection or retrospective budget change is made.

The first baseline was followed by the lower-LR trials and the second paired
seed. The current reviewed partial comparison appears below.

## Reviewed round progress

Only completed, saved-artifact-reviewed trajectories appear below. All use
3,000 updates, the same GPT-2 tokenizer and full-validation H200 endpoint.
This is a partial adaptive-validation comparison; no candidate is adopted
until the frozen screening and fresh-seed/width confirmation rule passes.

| Stage | Width | Seed | Peak LR | Raw CE | H200 CE | H200 bits/byte | Training seconds |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| screen | 64 | 2601 | 0.01 | 5.859556 | 5.610844 | 2.487729 | 254.74 |

| confirm | 64 | 2611 | 0.0025 | 5.261932 | 5.204370 | 2.307507 | 258.30 |

Paired H200 differences versus LR0.01 within the same stage, width and seed:

- screen, width64, seed2601, LR0.005: -0.168575 CE.
- screen, width64, seed2601, LR0.0025: -0.390637 CE.
- screen, width64, seed2602, LR0.0025: -0.322028 CE.
- screen, width64, seed2602, LR0.005: -0.096509 CE.

Frozen screening choice: LR0.0025. Confirmation results cannot change this choice.

Single-seed signs are preliminary. The controller remains serial, the source
and data contract are frozen, and test loss remains closed.
